## Dependency Policy

Purpose: Keep dependencies minimal, secure, and consistent.

### Adding Dependencies
- Prefer audited, actively maintained libraries
- Avoid duplicates (one router, one date library, etc.)
- Justify additions in PR description (why needed, alternatives considered)

### Versions
- Use caret ranges for libs; pin for tools if necessary (CI stability)
- Avoid implicit major upgrades in unrelated PRs

### Removal & Updates
- Remove unused deps regularly
- Group upgrades by area; run `pnpm build` and tests locally

### Forbidden
- Unmaintained or risky packages (document team blacklist if any)
- Bundling server-only packages into client code
